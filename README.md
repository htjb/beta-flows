# Beta-flows: Learning with the whole Nested Sampling run

Beta-flows are a density estimation tool that were intially designed
to improve the accuracy of more traditional normalising flows.

They are built using conditional masked autoregressive flows and utilise the
thermodynamic description of nested sampling during training.
